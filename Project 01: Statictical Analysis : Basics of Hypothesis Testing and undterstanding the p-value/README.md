# Project 01: Statistical Analysis — Hypothesis Testing & p-value

## Situation / Objective
You are given a sample dataset and need to use statistical analysis to draw defensible conclusions. The objective is to run exploratory analysis and formally test claims using hypothesis testing.

## Task
- Perform basic EDA to understand the data distribution and key summary statistics.
- Set up appropriate hypotheses.
- Run the statistical test(s) and interpret p-values and test statistics.
- Translate results into a clear conclusion about statistical significance.

## Actions
- Defined the **Null hypothesis (H0)** and **Alternative hypothesis (H1)** based on the business/statistical question.
- Explored the dataset (summary statistics and basic plots) to validate assumptions and understand variability.
- Executed hypothesis testing in R and computed p-values/test statistics.
- Interpreted results against a chosen significance level (e.g., 5%) and documented conclusions.

## Results / Summary
- Produced a complete hypothesis-testing workflow from setup to interpretation.
- Demonstrated how p-values and test statistics support (or fail to support) a statistically significant conclusion.
