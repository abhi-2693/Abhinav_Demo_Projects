# Project 04: Unsupervised Learning — Company Segmentation (Performance)

## Situation / Objective
You need to compare companies within an industry and identify groups with similar financial characteristics. The objective is to segment pharmaceutical companies using financial ratio features and derive interpretable performance groupings.

## Task
- Collect or load company financial ratios.
- Engineer/select features suitable for clustering.
- Segment companies into groups and interpret differences.

## Actions
- Collected and organized pharmaceutical sector data (ratios) and included company size categories.
- Prepared features for analysis (cleaning, scaling/normalization where needed).
- Conducted unsupervised analysis (clustering-style segmentation) and visual exploration to understand group separation.
- Summarized segment characteristics using key ratios (profitability, leverage, efficiency, valuation).

## Results / Summary
- Produced company segments that help compare performance/financial profiles across firms.
- Enabled quick identification of “similar peers” and outliers based on ratio patterns.
