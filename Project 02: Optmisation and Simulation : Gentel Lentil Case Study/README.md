# Project 02: Optimization & Simulation — Gentle Lentil Case Study

## Situation / Objective
A decision-maker must choose among uncertain career/ownership options. The objective is to quantify expected outcomes (mean) and risk (variance/standard deviation) under multiple scenarios and recommend a path.

## Task
- Compute expected monthly salary and its standard deviation under uncertainty.
- Evaluate the impact of a partnership scenario.
- Compare outcomes vs. alternative options (e.g., consulting offer and solo ownership).

## Actions
- Modeled uncertain outcomes using probability distributions / scenario trees in a spreadsheet.
- Calculated expected value and risk metrics (variance / standard deviation).
- Compared scenario results side-by-side and performed sensitivity-style checks on key assumptions.
- Summarized quantitative findings into a decision recommendation.

## Results / Summary
- Delivered a structured comparison of alternatives using both **return** (expected value) and **risk** (standard deviation).
- Highlighted how different assumptions shift the preferred choice, supporting decision-making under uncertainty.
