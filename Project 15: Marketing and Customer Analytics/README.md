# Project 15: Marketing & Customer Analytics (MnCA) — Multi-part Assignment

## Situation / Objective
Marketing decisions often require combining customer preference data, segmentation logic, and spend optimization across channels. The objective is to complete a multi-part MnCA assignment covering product optimization, segmentation, and advertising analytics.

## Task
- **Part 1:** Product optimization exercise based on customer preference/choice-style inputs.
- **Part 2:** Affinity-based segmentation.
- **Part 3:** Paid search bid optimization.
- **Part 4:** Display advertising assessment.

## Actions
- Cleaned and shaped input datasets for analysis (spreadsheet-based and CSV sources).
- Built segmentation logic and interpreted segment profiles.
- Formulated optimization objectives/constraints for marketing spend (bids) and solved for recommended allocations.
- Evaluated ad performance metrics and analyzed trade-offs.

## Results / Summary
- Produced a complete set of notebooks covering the assignment end-to-end.
- Generated actionable outputs: segment definitions, optimization-driven recommendations, and advertising performance insights.
