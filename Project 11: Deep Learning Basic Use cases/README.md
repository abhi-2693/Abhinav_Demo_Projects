# Project 11: Deep Learning Basics — Practical Use Cases

## Situation / Objective
Many real-world ML problems (churn prediction, spam detection, image classification) benefit from neural networks and deep learning workflows. The objective is to build hands-on understanding of core deep learning concepts and apply them to common tasks.

## Task
- Build intuition for forward propagation, loss functions, gradients, and backpropagation.
- Train deep learning models for:
  - Customer churn prediction
  - Spam classification (sequence/text)
  - Image classification using transfer learning
- Diagnose overfitting and validate model performance.

## Actions
- Worked through a fundamentals notebook to understand forward/backprop mechanics.
- Implemented and trained neural networks for supervised classification tasks.
- Applied sequence modeling for text classification.
- Used pretrained CNNs and fine-tuning/augmentation patterns for image classification.

## Results / Summary
- Created a set of reproducible notebooks demonstrating deep learning fundamentals and applied patterns.
- Built practical intuition for model training dynamics, validation, and generalization.
