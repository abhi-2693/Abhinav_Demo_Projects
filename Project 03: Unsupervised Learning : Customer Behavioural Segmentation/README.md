# Project 03: Unsupervised Learning — Customer Behavioral Segmentation

## Situation / Objective
A mall wants to understand different visitor behavior patterns to improve experience design and operational planning. The objective is to segment visitors using behavioral signals (dwell-time/engagement features).

## Task
- Prepare and normalize behavioral features.
- Choose an appropriate number of clusters.
- Interpret clusters into meaningful behavioral profiles.

## Actions
- Cleaned and normalized dwell-time features to ensure comparability.
- Applied **K-Means clustering** to group visitors based on engagement patterns.
- Used the **Elbow method** and **Silhouette score** to select the number of clusters.
- Interpreted segment profiles and ran additional behavioral cuts (e.g., filtering short visits/employees, comparing device cohorts) to validate insights.

## Results / Summary
- Produced interpretable visitor segments that reflect distinct engagement behaviors.
- Provided a repeatable approach for selecting clusters and validating segment stability.
