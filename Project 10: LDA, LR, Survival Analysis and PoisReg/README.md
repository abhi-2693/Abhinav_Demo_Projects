# Project 10: Telecom Churn Modeling — LDA, Logistic Regression, Survival Analysis, Poisson Regression

## Situation / Objective
Telecom churn is a core retention problem. The objective is to model churn and related outcomes using multiple statistical and machine-learning approaches and compare performance/interpretability.

## Task
- Prepare churn dataset for modeling.
- Train multiple models (classification + time-to-event style methods).
- Evaluate model performance and interpret results.

## Actions
- Performed data preparation (encoding/scaling where required).
- Built models including:
  - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
  - Logistic Regression
  - Survival analysis (Kaplan–Meier / Cox-style modeling)
  - Poisson regression approaches where applicable
- Evaluated models with standard metrics (accuracy/ROC-AUC/classification report) and diagnostic plots.

## Results / Summary
- Delivered a multi-method churn analysis showing how different techniques trade off interpretability vs predictive power.
- Documented an end-to-end workflow for churn modeling and evaluation.
