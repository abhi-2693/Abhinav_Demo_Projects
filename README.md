# Demo Projects Repository 
This is a Repository of the Projects and Assignments I have done during my ISB AMPBA Program.
This repository is solely for the purpose of showcasing my practical skills and knowledge gained throughout the course.

## Project List

### Project 1: Statictical Analysis : Basics of Hypothesis Testing and undterstanding the p-value  
 File Name : Statistical_analysis_Hypothesis Testing_basics.R

 In this I was given sample data and we have to perform the EDA, hypothesis testing on the data and examine the statistical significance via the p-value and test statistics. Key Learning from this project where 
- how to setup a Null Hypothesis and Alternate Hypothesis 
- Perform the hypothesis testing and examine the statistical significance via the p-value and test statistics
 
### Project 2: Optmisation and Simulation : Gentel Lentil Case Study 
 File Name : Gentel_Lentil_Case_Study_Optimisation_and_Simulation.xlsx
 
 Analyze the "The Gentle Lentil" case to compute expected monthly salary, its standard deviation, and the impact of a partnership—then compare outcomes against his consulting offer and running the restaurant solo.

 Key learnings from this project where
- Application of Optimization & Simulation Techniques – Using probability distributions, expected value, and variance to evaluate uncertain salary outcomes and compare different career options.
- Decision-Making under Uncertainty – Understanding how risk (measured by standard deviation) affects real-world business choices beyond just average returns.
- Scenario & Sensitivity Analysis – Evaluating different strategic options (consulting job, independent ownership, partnership) and testing how assumptions impact outcomes.
- Integration of Quantitative & Qualitative Insights – Combining numerical results with managerial judgment to arrive at a well-supported recommendation.

### Project 3: Unsupervised Learning : Customer Behavioural Segmentation 
 File Name : Mall_of_america.ipynb


### Project 4: Unsupervised Learning : Company Segmentation on the bases of Performance
 File Name : Sectoral_segment_part_1 and Sectoral_segment_part_2

### Project 5: Big Data Management Basics
 File Name : Big_data_management_basics.ipynb

 Key learnings from this project where
- the basics of Big Data Management PySpark and basiuc RDD operations and transformations

### Project 6: Causal Inference checks
 File Name : Causal_inference_project.Rmd and Causal_inference_project.html

 This report presents the analysis of wage data, focusing on the relationship between wages, IQ, and education. Our finding were that regression results suggest that both IQ and education have statistically significant effects on wages. The omitted variable bias check confirms the theoretical relationship between the simple and multiple regression coefficients.

### Project 7: Supervised Learning Basics : Decision Tree and MNIST Classification
 File Name : decision_tree.ipynb and tmnist.ipynb

 Key learnings from this project where
- Application of Decision Tree for classification and regression tasks
- Application of Parzen Window for classification of Mnist Data
- Application of KNN for classification of Mnist Data
- Application of Perceptron for classification of Mnist Data

### Project 8: Basket Item Recommendation System
File Name : Rec_sys.ipynb

 This scriot recommend the items to the customer based on the basket items (Did you forget to buy?) and there past purchase behavior using association rule and collaborative filtering.
 This was part of a Kaggle compition. Link - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/did-you-forget-b-25/leaderboard (Group 11)

### Project 9: MLOps : AWS based App deployment - Practice
File Name : many files

Key learing was how setup AWS registery and deploy the streamlit app using docker and docker compose ina EC2 Instance running in AWS. This was Basic deployment coveing the steps with guidance from out instructor on the steps and code.
