# Project 07: Supervised Learning Basics — Decision Trees & (t)MNIST Classification

## Situation / Objective
You need to build intuition for supervised learning classifiers using image-style datasets (MNIST/tMNIST) and compare classical methods. The objective is to implement and evaluate multiple classifiers and understand their trade-offs.

## Task
- Train baseline supervised models on MNIST-like data.
- Compare different learning algorithms.
- Evaluate model performance and interpret results.

## Actions
- Built and evaluated a Decision Tree model.
- Implemented and compared classic non-parametric / linear methods:
  - Parzen Window
  - k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Perceptron
- Used standard train/test evaluation and inspected performance qualitatively and quantitatively.

## Results / Summary
- Demonstrated how model choice affects accuracy, robustness, and complexity on MNIST-style classification tasks.
- Created reusable notebooks that serve as reference implementations for multiple supervised methods.

## Repository contents
- `decision_tree.ipynb`
- `tmnist.ipynb`
