# Project 08: Basket Item Recommendation System

## Situation / Objective
Retailers want to increase basket size by recommending relevant add-on items based on what a customer has already purchased. The objective is to recommend “missing” items using historical basket patterns.

## Task
- Learn item-to-item relationships from transaction/basket data.
- Generate recommendations from the current basket.
- Validate results in a competition-style setting.

## Actions
- Implemented recommendation logic based on:
  - Association rules (market-basket analysis)
  - Collaborative filtering concepts
- Generated candidate recommendations conditioned on the basket context.
- Iterated on approach and evaluated performance in a Kaggle competition environment.

## Results / Summary
- Produced a working notebook that recommends likely next items given a basket.
- Applied practical evaluation thinking (precision/quality trade-offs) typical of recommendation problems.
