# Project 19: Deep Learning — Classification & Segmentation

## Situation / Objective
Modern computer vision workflows require robust image classification pipelines with careful dataset handling and evaluation. The objective is to build and evaluate deep learning-based image classification workflows.

## Task
- Train image classification models using PyTorch (including transfer learning).
- Establish a robust dataset split strategy for evaluation.
- Evaluate models using standard classification metrics.

## Actions
- Implemented image classification pipelines using PyTorch + torchvision models.
- Built dataset splitting logic to separate training vs test sets based on file naming rules.
- Trained and evaluated models on the prepared splits and reviewed performance via classification reports.

## Results / Summary
- Produced reproducible notebooks for transfer-learning-based classification and split-based evaluation.
- Demonstrated practical understanding of dataset handling, model training loops, and metric-driven evaluation for image classification.
